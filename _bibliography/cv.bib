@article{KonCMA,
	abstract = {Complex Multiplication (CM) method is a frequently used method for the generation of prime order elliptic curves (ECs) over a prime field $\mathbb{F}\_p$. The most demanding and complex step of this method is the computation of the roots of a special type of class polynomials, called Hilbert polynomials. These polynonials are uniquely determined by the CM discriminant \(D\). The disadvantage of these polynomials is that they have huge coefficients and thus they need high precision arithmetic for their construction. Alternatively, Weber polynomials can be used in the CM method. These polynomials have much smaller coefficients and their roots can be easily transformed to the roots of the corresponding Hilbert polynomials. However, in the case of prime order elliptic curves, the degree of Weber polynomials is three times larger than the degree of the corresponding Hilbert polynomials and for this reason the calculation of their roots involves computations in the extension field \(\mathbb{F}\_{p^3}\). Recently, two other classes of polynomials, denoted by \(M\_{D,l}(x)\) and \(M\_{D,p\_1,p\_2}(x)\) respectively, were introduced which can also be used in the generation of prime order elliptic curves. The advantage of these polynomials is that their degree is equal to the degree of the Hilbert polynomials and thus computations over the extension field can be avoided. In this paper, we propose the use of a new class of polynomials. We will call them Ramanujan polynomials named after Srinivasa Ramanujan who was the first to compute them for few values of \(D\). We explicitly describe the algorithm for the construction of the new polynomials, show that their degree is equal to the degree of the corresponding Hilbert polynomials and give the necessary transformation of their roots (to the roots of the corresponding Hilbert polynomials). Moreover, we compare (theoretically and experimentally) the efficiency of using this new class against the use of the aforementioned Weber, \(M\_{D,l}(x)\) and \(M\_{D,p\_1,p\_2}(x)\) polynomials and show that they clearly outweigh all of them in the generation of prime order elliptic curves},

A crucial step of this method is to compute the roots of a special type of class field polynomials with the most commonly used being the Hilbert and Weber ones. These polynomials are uniquely determined by the CM discriminant D. In this paper, we consider a variant of the CM method for constructing elliptic curves (ECs) of prime order using Weber polynomials. In attempting to construct prime-order ECs using Weber polynomials, two difficulties arise (in addition to the necessary transformations of the roots of such polynomials to those of their Hilbert counterparts). The first one is that the requirement of prime order necessitates that $D\equiv3mod8$), which gives Weber polynomials with degree three times larger than the degree of their corresponding Hilbert polynomials (a fact that could affect efficiency). The second difficulty is that these Weber polynomials do not have roots in $p$ . In this work, we show how to overcome the above difficulties and provide efficient methods for generating ECs of prime order focusing on their support by a thorough experimental study. In particular, we show that such Weber polynomials have roots in the extension field p3 and present a set of transformations for mapping roots of Weber polynomials in $\mathbb{F}_{p^3}$ to roots of their corresponding Hilbert polynomials in $p$ . We also show how an alternative class of polynomials, with degree equal to their corresponding Hilbert counterparts (and hence having roots in p ), can be used in the CM method to generate prime-order ECs. We conduct an extensive experimental study comparing the efficiency of using this alternative class against the use of the aforementioned Weber polynomials. Finally, we investigate the time efficiency of the CM variant under four different implementations of a crucial step of the variant and demonstrate the superiority of two of them},

@article{AMC,
	abstract = {Class invariants are singular values of modular functions which generate the class fields of imaginary quadratic number fields. Their minimal polynomials, called class polynomials, are uniquely determined by a discriminant −D≤0 and are used in many applications, including the generation of elliptic curves. In all these applications, it is desirable that the size of the polynomials is as small as possible. Among all class polynomials, Weber polynomials constructed with discriminants $−D\equiv 1(mod8)$ have the smallest height and require the least precision for their construction. In this paper, we will show that this fact does not necessarily lead to the most efficient computations, since the congruences modulo 8 of the discriminants affect the degrees of the polynomials},

Moreover, we obtain that $\Gamma_2(X(N),\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_N))$ is always finite where $\zeta_N$ is an $N$-th primitive root of unity, hence, in particular, the number of quadratic points is finite for any model $X_N$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ of $X(N)$. Secondly we make available a proof that the automorphism group of $X(N)$ coincides with the normalizer of $\Gamma(N)$ in $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ modulo $\Gamma(N)$, in particular no exceptional automorphisms appear for $X(N)$},
